# Code used for the GSI-UPM SemEval2019 Task 5 submission

This repository contains the code used for the submissions to Task 5.
We have participated in both subtasks, as well as in the two avaialalble languages: Spanish and English.

Our implementation relies heavily in (scikit-learn)[https://scikit-learn.org/], (pandas)[https://pandas.pydata.org/], and (gsitk)[https://github.com/gsi-upm/gsitk].
To install them, please use `pip`:

```
pip install scikit-learn pandas gsitk
```
